\subsection{Returning Counterexamples (50P)}
So far, when a formula does not hold for a TS, MiniCheck cannot help the user to repair the TS. With 
this extension, you are asked to provide a so called counterexample (CE) for the property when the formula is not 
satisfied, together with the ``false'' result.

A CE is a run of a transition system $s_0 \xrightarrow[]{\alpha_0} s_1 \xrightarrow[]{\alpha_1} s_2 \xrightarrow[]{\alpha_2} \dots s_i (\xrightarrow[]{\alpha_i} s_{i+1} \xrightarrow[]{\alpha_{i+1}} \dots s_n \xrightarrow[]{\alpha_n})^{\omega}$ such 
that the path $s_0s_1s_2 \dots (s_is_{i+1} \dots s_n )^{\omega}$ does not satisfy $\varphi$.

\subsection{Satisfiability Checking}
On the \code{--sat} flag, the Model Checker constructs the FSA starting from the input formula
and perform the fair-cycle detection module on \textbf{this automaton only}. 
This procedure amounts at verifying whether the formula is satisfiable by any string. 

\subsection{Validity Checking}
On the \code{--val} flag, the Model Checker constructs the FSA starting from \textbf{negation of} 
the input formula and perform the fair-cycle detection module on \textbf{this automaton only}. 
Then, it must return the negation of the result.
This procedure amounts at verifying whether the formula is valid, i.e., it is satisfied by any string. 

\subsubsection*{Note}
It is up to you to decide whether changing the format of the input file(s)
(e.g., by forbidding to include the Transition System in the file) 
that can go in hand with the \code{--sat} and \code{--val} flags.

\section{Bonus Task - Returning a Counterexample for LTL properties (10 P)} \label{sec::bonus2}
On the \code{--ce} flag, the Model Checker returns a Counterexample (CE) if the formula is 
not satisfied. A CE is a sequence of states of the TS of the form $s_0s_1 \dots (s_n \dots s_m )^{\omega}$
such that $L(s_0)L(s_1) \dots (L(s_n) \dots L(s_m) )^{\omega}$ does not satisfy the input property $\varphi$.
